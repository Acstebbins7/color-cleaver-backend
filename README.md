# Color Cleaver - Back End

### Introduction

This app will tell you what secondary color comes from two primary colors, as well as what primary colors make up a secondary.

You don't really need to know your color wheel. Google is there, but also: the tests will just tell you what strings they expect!


### Setup

Fork, clone, run `jest --watch-all`, and code until your face turns blue or your tests turn green. Whichever comes first!
